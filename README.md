# Hi 👋 I'm hongmei 👩‍💻

I have a passion for both front-end and back-end development. I'm currently in my final year of [university](https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/bsc-information-technology-and-business-erp-bherp) pursuing a degree in information technology and business 👩‍🎓. I aspire toward a career that allows me to use my creativity to bridge the gap between back-end engineering 🌈  and  🌈 front-end design.

My career goal (and life goal) is to be happy 😃 and I am the happiest when I'm working hard to produce creative and efficient application that helps others.

When I'm not typing away in front of my computer, I'm probably tending to my plant   🌱   babies.
