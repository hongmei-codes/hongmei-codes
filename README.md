# Hi 👋 I'm hongmei 👩🏻‍💻

I'm currently in my final year of [university](https://www.suss.edu.sg/programmes/detail/bsc-information-technology-and-business-erp-bherp) pursuing a degree in information technology and business 👩🏻‍🎓 I have created personal projects from simple static web pages to complex web applications. I always strive to write clean and readable codes that are a breeze to maintain. I aspire toward a career that allows me to use my creativity to bridge the gap between back-end engineering 🌈  and  🌈 front-end design. Work to me is the best form of education. I'm always on the look out for opportunities to learn from and work with those who are willing to inspire me with their wisdom.

My career (and life) goal is to be happy 😃 and I am the happiest when my brain is working hard at producing creative and efficient solutions that solve problems. The ultimate happiness for me comes from moments when my mind is in full-fledged problem-solving mode. What makes my day worthwhile in the end is building elegant solutions with people who bring out the best in me.
